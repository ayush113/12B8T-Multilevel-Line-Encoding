<h2>Abstract:</h2>
To send data from one node to another we need to convert information into 
digital or analog signals. Line coding schemes are used to convert digital data
to digital signals.The paper introduced a new Multilevel Line Coding(12B8T). 
The paper claims that this theme overcomes the inherent faults of existing
encoding methods , it eliminates the problem with self synchronization, it has 
no DC components, and it performs better than existing methods of encoding like,
4B3T and 8B6T in terms of speed of transmission, bandwidth and signal rate.

<h2>Objectives:</h2>
1. Implement 12B8T Multilevel Line Coding Scheme.
2. Comparison with other existing methods.
