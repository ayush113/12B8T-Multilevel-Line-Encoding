# Introduction to 12B8T Multilevel line coding scheme

In this project we are planning to implement a 12B8T Multilevel line coding scheme. This scheme has less bandwidth requirement and has a higher transmission speed than the standard 4B3T and 8B6T multilevel line coding schemes.

In 12B8T multilevel line coding scheme , a twelve bit pattern is encoded into a pattern of eight signal elements where they have three levels. Thus m = 12 , n = 8, L = 3. In this project we reduce the signal rate and increase data rate. 

The average signal rate of this scheme is S(avg) = 0.5 *  N  *  8/12. We want to implement this multilevel line coding scheme and compare the performance of this to the performance of the 4B3T and 8B6T.
